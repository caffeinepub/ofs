  "summary": "Most requested offline-first guest mode functionality appears implemented: unauthenticated users land on an OfflineDashboard, backend React Query hooks are guarded by identity, offline share packages (self-contained HTML) can be exported/imported, received files can be saved via File System Access API with download fallback, and a service worker + manifest enable offline app-shell caching with clear offline messaging for online-only features. However, the diff shows a modification to a file explicitly constrained as 'do not edit' (useInternetIdentity.ts).",
